No indication of how they work as a team member, only as a manager... depending on how the workplace is set up, not sure how she would do as the person not in charge.

She has multiple years of experience in the management field.

Even though she has multiple years experience, she can still be considered not as seasoned as others in the field, and therefore possibly more open-minded to compromise and new methods of training.

From what she posted on her resume, it seems she can provide direct proof of that she has directly benifitted the current company she works for.

Cons:
She doesn't seem to stay/last long at a company for more than a few years (lacks longevity thus far).

Even with her years of experience, she may still be somewhat naive/not as seasoned and experienced as others applying.

There's nothing that shows awards, or moments of recognition made by her superiors.




",86,4,140000,Moderately promotable,Yes,Yes,6,6,6,Extremely,Extremely,6,Extremely,6,6,6,"Pros:
The University of Texas at Austin is well known for their business programs and has educated many successful managers that are currently working in the field. It is not an easy major to be accepted for at that school.

from the strategies and development building she has shown on her resume, she seems like someone that pays attention to detail, which is crucial for anyone in the management career path.

She has a diverse work background, which may be helpful as someone to bring new insight and new ideas to the table.

Cons:
She seems to have an established life in Texas. If this job isn't based all or mostly on telecommunication, how can you be sure she wouldn't become homesick and want to move back home, or that if she does become sad or homesick that it wouldn't change her work ethic?

Even though she has years of experience, there isn't anything showing that she has directly worked under the title as a manager.

With her current employer listed on her resume, the description underneath is kind of wordy and may show that the applicant can be a bit disorganized when it comes to thought process/execution.

The breadth of her experience at Atlantic Consultants is very impressive.

She has years of management experience at three different firms. 

Her resume gives her the appearance of being a result oriented ""do-er"".

3 Cons:
Unclear why her personal address is listed as a New York address, while her present employer is in Michigan. (Does she tele-commute? Do they have a New York branch?)

The dates of her MBA courses clash somewhat with her work experience. Was the job in Detroit as a ""New Product Associate"" part time? Did she get her MBA online? Probably a simple explanation but I'm still curious about the discrepancy because the dates overlap.

How involved is she as a Neighborhood Coordinator in Detroit while living in New York City?





",70,2,145000,Moderately promotable,Yes,Yes,6,5,5,4,5,3,3,4,5,4,"3 pros:

I like that her marketing experience produced results.
(Although the dates don't match her accomplishment claims, I'll assume it's a typo: ""16M in overall marketing benefits by 2006"" when she started in 2012).

She appears adept at mixing her financial acumen with the creative side that marketing demands. 

Her experience and responsibility grew substantially with each new position. 

3 cons:
For a marketing whiz, her resume doesn't sing. It doesn't sell her work.

I don't get a clear sense of passion or vision from her resume.

Her client list isn't especially impressive. Can she bring in new business?

- Extensive web / internet experience which is helpful to most companies.

- Candidate has shown ability to identify issues, and execute on projects to help client's revenues and bottom line.
